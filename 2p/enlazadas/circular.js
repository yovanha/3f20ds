/* 
Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns 
the node at the beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION: Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer 
points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
EXAMPLE: Input: A -> B -> C -> 0 -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output: C 
*/

/* Our algorithm is derived directly from parts 1, 2 and 3.
1. Create two pointers, FastPointer and SlowPointer.
2. Move FastPointer at a rate of 2 steps and SlowPointer at a rate of 1 step.
3. When they collide, move SlowPointer to LinkedListHead. Keep FastPointer where it is.
4. Move SlowPointer and FastPointer at aÂ·rate of one step. Return the new collision point. */
